# Python van Gogh

A simple Python script to recreate given images.
Takes an image and creates two images of the same size. Then picks a random color from the original image and draws a line of that of random length and width on first image. If first image is more like the original, overwrites the second image with the contents of first image, and vice versa.

The script takes roughly 30 min to execute 1 mil iterations when logging is enabled.

Script in action:
